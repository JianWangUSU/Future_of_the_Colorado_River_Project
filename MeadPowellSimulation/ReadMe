Title: Lake Powell Lake Mead simulation with PyNSim.

Code in Python.
Before diving into the code, the author suggests to read PyNSim first. http://umwrg.github.io/pynsim/ or https://github.com/UMWRG/pynsim

"components":    Define your personal Node, Link and Institution class
"data":          Store basic reservoir data, such as Lake Powell elevation-area-volume table.
"engines":       Define your personal engine. What is an engine? Please read http://umwrg.github.io/pynsim/. In this project, personal engine is not defined and used.
"results":       Store decision scaling analysis results.
"simulators":    Reservoir simulatior is defined in this folder and the project start running from this folder.

Now: 
(1) Simulate Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.
Questions:       Under what combination of inflow and demand will Lake Mead go dry or get full? How long does it take?
Research object: Lake Mead. 
Operation step:  Annually.
Inflow:          Inflow to Lake Mead ranges from 6 to 14 MAF/per year. 
Demand:          Water for Lake Mead to release ranges from 6 to 12 MAF/per year.
Initial Storage: Jan, 2020 Lake Mead actual storage.
Evap rate:       6 feet/year. (Table 2, Schmidt, John C. (2016) Fill Mead First Technical Report)
Policy:          Use Drought Contingency Plan when Mead elevation is below 1025 feet, otherwise reservoir release equals to demand.
Simulation:      Get different combination of inflow and demand. 
                 For each of these combinations, simulate Lake Mead release with the policy mentioned above. 
                 Note that for each combiantion, inflow and demand don't change over time. 
Main Code:       MeadSimulation.py in "simulators" folder.
Result:          Shown in LakeMeadResults.pdf under the "results" folder. 
                 Numbers shown on blue lines represent number of years Lake Mead go dry.
                 Numbers shown on green lines represent number of years Lake Mead get to full pool.
                 Numbers shown on red lines represent the final static reservoir storage for Lake Mead.



(2) Simulate Combined reservoir of Lake Powell and Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.

Future:
(3) Simulate joint operation of Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Reproduce:
Download the code and data. Install pynsim, numpy and matplotlib. Change the file path in MeadSimulation.py and PowellMeadSimulation.py to your local path.
