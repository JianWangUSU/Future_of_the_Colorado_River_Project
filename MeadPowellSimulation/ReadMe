Title: Lake Powell Lake Mead simulation with PyNSim.

Code in Python.
Before diving into the code, the author suggests to read PyNSim first. http://umwrg.github.io/pynsim/ or https://github.com/UMWRG/pynsim

Folder explanations
".idea"        Most people can ignore this folder, please read the link if you are interested in this folder. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17049416/what-is-the-idea-folder
"components"   Define your personal Node, Link and Institution class
"data"         Store basic reservoir data, such as Lake Powell elevation-area-volume table.
"engines"      Define your personal engine. What is an engine? Please read http://umwrg.github.io/pynsim/. In this project, personal engine is not defined and used.
"results"      Store decision scaling analysis results.
"simulators"   Reservoir simulatior is defined in this folder and the project start running from this folder.

Now: 
(1) Simulate Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.
Main Code:       MeadSimulation.py in "simulators" folder.
Questions:       Under what combination of inflow and demand will Lake Mead go dry or get full? How long does it take?
Research object: Lake Mead. 
Operation step:  Annually.
Input:           Inflow to Lake Mead ranges from 6 MAF/per year to 14 MAF/per year. Water for Lake Mead to release is from 6 MAF/per year to 12 MAF/per year.
Simulation:      Under the combination of different demand and inflow, 
Policy:          Use Drought Contingency Plan when Mead elevation is below 1025 feet, otherwise release equals to demand.
Result:          Shown in LakeMeadResults.pdf under the "results" folder.

(2) Simulate Combined reservoir of Lake Powell and Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.

Future:
(3) Simulate joint operation of Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Reproduce:
Download the code and data. Install pynsim, numpy and matplotlib. Change the file path in MeadSimulation.py and PowellMeadSimulation.py to your local path.
