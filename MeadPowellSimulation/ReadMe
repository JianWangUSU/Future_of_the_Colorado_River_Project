Title: Lake Powell Lake Mead simulation with PyNSim.

Code in Python.
Before diving into the code, the author suggests to read PyNSim first. http://umwrg.github.io/pynsim/ or https://github.com/UMWRG/pynsim

Progress: 
(1) Simulate Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.
(2) Simulate Combined reservoir of Lake Powell and Lake Mead under drought contingency plan with static water demand and water supply.
(3) Next: simulate joint operation of Lake Powell and Lake Mead and combine river ecosystem model.
