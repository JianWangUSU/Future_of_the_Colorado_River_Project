Description:
  This folder is used to generate the plot that shows scenarios of Upper Colorado River Basin consumptive water use predicated by Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Upper Colorado River Commission (UCRC) and used in CRSS (BOR/CRSS) in comparison to actual use. 

Application:
  The generated plot has been used in Figure 5 in the white paper "Managing the Colorado River for an Uncertain Future" and one blog post "Scenarios Consistently Overestimate Consumptive Water Use in the Upper Colorado River Basin"
